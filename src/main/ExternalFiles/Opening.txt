You are sound asleep from a long day of camp activities,
when suddenly you hear a loud crashing sound outside your cabin.
You decide to go investigate and notice that the campfire is still burning.
You go to extinguish the fire and see something strange.
There are three mysterious journals lying next to the campfire.
