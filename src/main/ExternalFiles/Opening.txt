You are sound asleep from a long day of camp activities,
when suddenly you hear a loud crashing sound outside your cabin.
You decide to go investigate and notice that the campfire is still burning.
You go to extinguish the fire and see something strange.
There are three mysterious journals lying next to the campfire.

The cover of the first journal is colored red and is very elegant. The title of the journal is “Chronicles of the Night: The Immortal” written in bold, black letters that seem to glow in the dark.

The cover of the second journal is colored brown and has a huge scratch mark. The title of the journal is “Chronicles of the Night:  Moon Phases” written in bold, silver letters that seem to glow in the dark.

The cover of the third journal is colored blue and is semi-translucent. The title of the journal is “Chronicles of the Night:  Echoes from Beyond” written in bold, green letters that seem to glow in the dark.
